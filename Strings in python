PROGRAM 1:
Upper Case and Lower Case:
There are 50 students in the class. The teacher wants to arrange them in the height order. So help the teacher to find the smallest person and tallest to arrange.(count the number of lowercase letters and uppercase letters in a string.) Problem Description The program takes a string and counts the number of lowercase letters and uppercase letters in the string. Problem Solution 1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a lowercase character is encountered and increment the second count variable each time a uppercase character is encountered. 4. Print the total count of both the variables. 5. Exit.

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of one string.

Output consists of two integers.

First output consists of count of the uppercase.

Second output consists of count of the lowercase.

CODE:
str1 = input()
upper = 0

for i in range(len(str1)):
    if str1[i].isupper():
        upper += 1
lower = len(str1) - upper
print(upper)
print(lower)

PROGRAM 2:

First output refers to the count of the words.

Second output refers to the count of the characters in a given string,

Sample Input & Output:

Cyfuno

1

6

CODE:
str1 = input()
space = str1.count(" ")
words = space + 1
letters = len(str1)
print(words)
print(letters)

PROGRAM 3:

Number of Digits and Letters in a String:
Write a Python Program to calculate the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Description The program takes a string and calculates the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Solution 1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a digit is encountered and increment the second count variable each time a character is encountered. 4. Print the total count of both the variables. 5. Exit.

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of a string
Otput consists of two integers.
First output refers to the total count of the characters.
Second output refers to the total count of the digits.
Sample Input & Output:

Cyfuno2020
Characters = 6
Digits = 4

CODE:
str1 = input()
numbers = 0
for i in range(len(str1)):
    if str1[i].isdigit():
        numbers += 1
print("Characters = ",len(str1) - numbers)
print("Digits = ",numbers)



PROGRAM 4:
Characters in Ascending order:
Write a python code to arrange the characters in ascending order of the given String

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of a string.

Output consists of a sorted string.

Sample Input & Output:

cyfuno

cfnouy

CODE:
str1 = input().lower()
lst = list(str1)
asc = []
final = []
str2 = ""
for i in lst:
    a = ord(i)
    asc.append(a)
asc.sort()
for i in asc:
    b = chr(i)
    final.append(b)
for i in final:
    str2 += i
print(str2)




PROGRAM 5:
Form a new string made:
Write a Python Program to form a new string made of the first 2 characters and last 2 characters from a given string. Problem Description The program takes a string and forms a new string made of the first 2 characters and last 2 characters from a given string. Problem Solution 1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 2. Initialize a count variable to 0. 3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the count variable each time. 4. Form the new string using string slicing. 5. Print the newly formed string. 6. Exit.

Sample Input:

Hello World

Sample Output:

 Held

CODE:
str1 = input()
str2 = str1[:2] + str1[len(str1) - 2:]
print(str2)




PROGRAM 6:
Remove the nth index:
Write a Python Program to remove the nth index character from a non-empty string.

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of a string and one string.

First input consists of a string.

Second input refers to the index position.

Output consists of a string.

Sample Input & Output:

cyfuno technologies

4

cyfuo technologies

CODE:
str1 = input()
index = int(input())
str2 = ""
for i in range(len(str1)):
    if i != index:
        str2 += str1[i]
print(str2)






PROGRAM 7:
Replace all occurrences:

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of one string and one character and one special character.

First input consists of a string.

Second input consists of a character which you want to change.

Third input consists of a special symbol which you want to replace.

Output consists of a string which is modified string.

Sample Input:

Cyfuno

y

%

Sample Output:

Modified string:

C%funo


CODE:
str1 = input()
char = input()
index = str1.index(char)
special = input()
str2 = ""
for i in range(len(str1)):
    if i == index:
        str2 += special
    else:
        str2 += str1[i]
print("Modified string:")
